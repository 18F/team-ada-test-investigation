# team-ada-test-investigation
A place for code and stuff relating to team Ada's Friday investigation of our test suite

# Things to do some Friday
## CI pipeline test data scraper (jmax)
## Test data repository/munging (jmax)

# Ideas and stuff
- spec/services/encryptions/aes_cipher_spec.rb:5 - why use random data?
- All specs - can we easily look for spec-embedded class definitions and vet them for collisions?
